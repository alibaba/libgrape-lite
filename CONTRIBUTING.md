#### Open a pull request

Contributing to libgrape-lite requires submitting your patch as a Github pull
request. We'll ask you to prefix the pull request title with the issue number
and the kind of patch (`BUGFIX` or `FEATURE`) in brackets, for example,
`[BUGFIX-1234] Fix crash in running SSSP on the p2p graph` or
`[FEATURE-2345] Support loading graph data from HDFS`.

libgrape-lite runs typical graph analytical algorithms on the `p2p-31` graph
as the test suite. Before submitting your pull request, make sure the test suite
hasn't been break. You can run the test suite using the following command under
the `build` directory,

```bash
../misc/app_tests.sh
```

#### Resolve conflict

You generally do NOT need to rebase your pull requests unless there are merge
conflicts with master. When Github complaining that "Canâ€™t automatically merge"
on your pull request, you'll be asked to rebase your pull request on top of
the latest master branch, using the following commands:

+ First rebasing to the most recent master:

      git remote add upstream https://github.com/alibaba/libgrape-lite.git
      git fetch upstream
      git rebase upstream/master

+ Then git may show you some conflicts when it cannot merge, say `conflict.cpp`,
  you need
  - Maually modify the file to resolve the conflicts
  - After resolved, mark it as resolved by
  
        git add conflict.cpp

+ Then you can continue rebase by

      git rebase --continue

+ Finally push to your fork, then the pull request will be got updated:

      git push --force
