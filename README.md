**libgrape-lite** is a C++ library from Alibaba for parallel graph processing. It differs from prior systems in its ability to parallelize sequential graph algorithms as a whole by following the *PIE* programming model from [GRAPE](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3035918.3035942). Sequential algorithms can be easily ["plugged into"](examples/analytical_apps/sssp/sssp_auto.h) libgrape-lite with only minor changes and get parallelized to handle large graphs efficiently. In addition to the ease of programming, libgrape-lite is designed to be highly [efficient](Performance.md) and [flexible](examples/gnn_sampler), to cope the scale, variety and complexity from real-life graph applications.

## Building **libgrape-lite**

### Dependencies
**libgrape-lite** is developed and tested on CentOS 7. It should also work on other unix-like distributions. Building libgrape-lite requires the following softwares installed as dependencies.

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (>=2.8)
- A modern C++ compiler compliant with C++-11 standard. (g++ >= 4.8.1 or clang++ >= 3.3)
- [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/) (>= 2.1.4) or [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) (>= 3.0.0)
- [glog](https://github.com/google/glog) (>= 0.3.4)


Here are the dependencies for optional features:
- [jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net/) (>= 5.0.0) for better memory allocation;
- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) (>= 1.8) for generating documentation;
- Linux [HUGE_PAGES](http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt) support, for better performance.

Extra dependencies are required by examples:
- [gflags](https://github.com/gflags/gflags) (>= 2.2.0);
- [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka) (>= 2.3.0);
- [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka)(>= 0.11.3);


### Building libgrape-lite and examples

Once the required dependencies have been installed, go to the root directory of libgrape-lite and do a out-of-source build using CMake.

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

The building targets include a shared/static library, and two sets of examples: [analytical_apps](./examples/analytical_apps) and a [gnn_sampler](./examples/gnn_sampler).

Alternatively, you can build a particular target with command:

```bash
make libgrape-lite # or
make analytical_apps # or
make gnn_sampler
```

## Running libgrape-lite applications

### Graph format

The input of libgrape-lite is formatted following the [LDBC Graph Analytics](http://graphalytics.org) benchmark, with two files for each graph, a `.v` file for vertices with 1 or 2 columns, which are a vertex_id and optionally followed by the data assigned to the vertex; and a `.e` file for edges with 2 or 3 columns, representing source, destination and optionally the data on the edge, correspondingly. See sample files `p2p-31.v` and `p2p-31.e` under the [dataset](dataset/) directory. 

### Example applications

**libgrape-lite** provides six algorithms from the LDBC benchmark as examples. The deterministic algorithms are, single-source shortest path(SSSP), connected component(WCC), PageRank, local clustering coefficient(LCC), community detection of label propagation(CDLP), and breadth first search(BFS).    

To run a specific analytical application, users may use command like this:

```bash
# run single-source shortest path with 4 workers in local.
mpirun -n 4 ./run_app --vfile ../dataset/p2p-31.v --efile ../dataset/p2p-31.e --application sssp --sssp_source 0 --out_prefix ./output_sssp --directed

# or run connected component with 4 workers on a cluster.
# HOSTFILE provides a list of hosts where MPI processes are launched. 
mpirun -n 4 -hostfile HOSTFILE ./run_app --application=wcc --vfile ../dataset/p2p-31.v --efile ../dataset/p2p-31.e --out_prefix ./output_wcc

# see more flags info.
./run_app --help
```

### LDBC benchmarking

The analytical applications support the LDBC Analytical Benchmark suite with the provided `ldbc_driver`. Please refer to [ldbc_driver](./ldbc_driver) for more details. The benchmark results for libgrape-lite and other state-of-the-art systems could be found [here](Performance.md).

### GNN sampler

In addition to offline graph analytics, libgrape-lite could also be utilized to handle more complex graph tasks. A sampler for GNN training/inference on dynamic graphs (taking graph changes and queries, and producing results via [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)) is included as an example. Please refer to [examples/gnn_sampler](./examples/gnn_sampler) for more details.

## Documentation

Documentation is generated using Doxygen. Users can build doxygen documentation in the build directory using:

```bash
cd build
make doc
# open docs/index.html
```
