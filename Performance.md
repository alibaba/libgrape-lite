# Performance

We evaluated performance of **libgrape-lite** with [LDBC Graph Analytics Benchmark](http://graphalytics.org/). In addition to the ease of programming, we find that **libgrape-lite** achieves high performance comparably to the state-of-the-art systems. The experiments were conducted on 4 instances of [r6.8xlarge](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/25378.htm#d12e563) on [AlibabaCloud ECS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/ecs), each with 32 threads, over LDBC XL-size datasets. Instances are imaged with [Aliyun Linux (a CentOS-variant)](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/111881.htm).

We compared **libgrape-lite** with [PowerGraph](https://github.com/jegonzal/PowerGraph)(commit a038f97
) [GeminiGraph](https://github.com/thu-pacman/GeminiGraph)(commit 170e7d3
) and [Plato](https://github.com/Tencent/plato)(commit 21009d6). Each system is built with GCC(v4.8.5) and MPICH(v3.1). To make the comparisons fair, **libgrape_lite** was built with HUGE_PAGES and jemalloc disabled.

We made minor changes on their code and datasets:
- Turned on `-O3` optimization for all three systems.
- Added timing stubs for Plato.
- Replaced the random-pick logic with the deterministic logic from LDBC for the CDLP in Plato.
- Changed the weight type of SSSP from `float` to `double` in GeminiGraph.
- Changed the load strategy from `load_directed` to `load_undirected_from_directed` for PageRank in GeminiGraph
- Reformat the datasets to adapt Plato and GeminiGraph's formats (e.g., 0-based continuous vertex ids)

We used “default” code provided by the competitor systems when it is available. 
- **N/A** indicate that the system didn't provide the application. And
- **X**  indicates the results produced are not consistent with the verified results provided by LDBC.

The inconsistences of PageRank come from different settings on convergence conditions. 
To give a comprehensive comparison, we made our best efforts to revise our application([pagerank_local.h](examples/analytical_apps/pagerank/pagerank_local.h)), making them output the same results as competitor systems.
The performance results are shown as below.

## Reproducing the results

We will release a public image containing the script, together with all the systems and datasets on AlibabaCloud and AWS soon.
